Sennheiser is well known for this, and definitely live up to expectations here. You can tune them to your liking with an optional bass boost toggle in the app that makes music very punchy, which in my opinion adds a lot to these headphones.While the experience on mobile has been seamless with no issues, the same cannot be said for desktop. Periodically on desktop there is connection dropout with bursts of static upon reconnection.Notwithstanding the connection, this pair of headphones are my first with ANC. I think it works well enough, although from what I've seen it's hardly comparable to Sony's XM5s.The touch controls are sensitive, as many others have said. However, I don't find it to be much of an issue on a day-to-day basis. While having buttons would be nice, I find the touch controls to be rather intuitive and have come to like them.Overall, with the great sound and controls, I can easily say it's worth the price and more than makes up for the slight issues that you may come across when using them. I am more leaning towards 4 stars for this review, but in my personal opinion it gets a 5.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"timestamp\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 91,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2024\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"profile_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"AHWHDQ2NV7UMZ6CUMUT7GXH2FKTA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_verified\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"helpful_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 45,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 376,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29,\n        \"samples\": [\n          9\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"product_attributes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

However, my enthusiasm quickly waned when the headphones abruptly stopped working after a mere eight months of use.\",\n          \"These headphones are a perfect example of \\\"you get what you pay for\\\". I paid around 40 USD. The fit and finish and mechanical build quality are good. The sound quality is just ok, noticeably worse than wired headphones back in the day, but not so bad that it bothers me. They're comparable to my 16 dollar no name earbuds.I took them apart for a reason I'll get to later, and there isn't much inside. Very small speakers, small battery, and small circuit board. Clearly nothing fancy, but the quality of these things was good.I bought them for running, because my earbuds always fall out. As soon as I had the box in my hand, I realized I should have bought something waterproof. ..However I looked on amazon, and there were very few options for water proof over ear headphones in this price range. So I decided to keep them, and conformal coat the electronics. That's why I opened them up. To others that may want to do the same, taking them apart is quite easy.I think they will be perfect for running and workouts, as they are light weight and clamp onto my head tightly.Overall I'm happy, but they're just about how nice you would expect for the price.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"timestamp\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 280,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024\",\n          \"Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2023\",\n          \"Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"profile_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 998,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"AFFTLQS5N2ZGFLJCJEYVS2XE4DAQ\",\n          \"AGPDRP7KIRQONYQ73GTCBB53CUZA\",\n          \"AG2QRAXQP5UCFPVDFIKQNGHKN63Q\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_verified\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"helpful_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 69,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1628,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 69,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"product_attributes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 32,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
